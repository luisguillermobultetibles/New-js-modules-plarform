# New modules platform proposal


##files of the 
stable version 29/10/2025:

### •loader-demo.html
### •app.html
### •install.html


## Details

   The main objective is to provid a non `file-system` based schema for progressive web applications (PWA) library access.
  
   This demo is a basic frame-work to show the possibility of modular scripting programming without the problems inherent to files.
  
  This let you.
  
  1. Dispose your app from carry files and heavy inline script functions.
  2. Perform a high quality supervised installation managing without extra resources o more dependencies than a web browser.
  3. Easify the code reuse, in a cleaner architecture.
  4. Dynamize the page loads with just one time library installation.
  5. Organize easily a distributed app... 
  6. Makes your app installable, from an authentic page, etc.

  
### Interface details
  
  •first, just use install.html to manage the localStorage system 
  •then may use loader-demo.html to check some features.
  •finally, test with app.html
  •you are free to review/modify source code.
  •I suggest keep it's originality by following me, or helping me to develope it.

### Implementation details

  •The usual libraries are loaded onto local web Stogare system without loss of functionalities.
  •All units are visible each other.
  
  todo:
  
  0. Or not to do: don't replicates a new file system onto storage or library provider, src/extras folder was given just for backward compatibility, understandings ideas and development, I strongly recommend solve it using namespace dots, without externals .js files, like in the three .html's demos.
  1. trasitional compatibility fallback 
  2. version control (and/or github or other source code integration)
  3. implements a dependency solver
  4. securities issues, integrity check, compression, etc...
  5. improve this help, formalize this std, to a new Ecma proposal
  6. improve the IDE (actually disconnected)
  7. have a good luck, there's is a lot of work
  8. use modules on client side without a server.
